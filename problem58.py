Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way,
a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of
primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
